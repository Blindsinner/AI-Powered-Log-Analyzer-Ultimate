## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-File & ZIP Upload**: Drag and drop multiple log files (e.g., `.log`, `.txt`) or a single `.zip` archive, which is decompressed in-browser.
-   **Intelligent Error Parsing**: Scans logs for keywords (e.g., `error`, `failed`), error codes (e.g., `0x80070005`, `ORA-00942`), and patterns (HTTP status codes, Java exceptions) using prioritized regex matching.
-   **Advanced AI Analysis**:
    -   Supports multiple providers: **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **Custom/Local LLMs** (e.g., Ollama).
    -   Generates a detailed **Description**, potential **Impact**, a **Severity** level (Critical, High, Medium, Low), and actionable **Solutions** for each error group.
    -   Includes a "Analyze All" feature for batch processing.
-   **Rich Visualization Dashboard**:
    -   Displays key stats: unique errors, total occurrences, and files analyzed.
    -   Features an interactive timeline chart (via `Recharts`) to visualize error frequency and severity over time.
-   **Detailed & Filterable Results**:
    -   Groups errors by key, sorted by frequency.
    -   Presents results in expandable cards showing AI analysis and the original log contexts.
    -   Includes a search bar for quickly filtering results.
-   **Data Explorer**: An experimental SQL-like query interface (e.g., `SELECT * FROM logs WHERE message contains 'denied'`) for custom log searches.
-   **Secure & Private**: All processing is client-side. No data ever leaves your browser. API keys are stored in `localStorage` and are not transmitted to any server.
-   **Versatile Exporting**: Generate and download reports in `HTML`, `CSV`, `TSV`, `XML`, `DATAGRID` (detailed log entries), or `CHART` (timeline data) formats.
-   **Responsive Design**: A clean, mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS that works on any device.

<a id="how-it-works"></a>
## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This is a single-page application (SPA) built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Recharts**. All logic runs client-side in your browser.

1.  **File Handling**: When you upload files, they are read directly into the browser's memory. `.zip` archives are decompressed on-the-fly using `JSZip`.
2.  **Parsing**: Based on the selected format (`AUTO` is recommended), a specific parser processes the file content. For example, `.csv` files are parsed for columns like `timestamp` and `message`, while `.log` files are typically read line-by-line (`TEXTLINE`).
3.  **Error Detection**: The `analyzeLogEntries` function scans each log entry against a prioritized list of regular expressions. It looks for high-priority patterns like Java exceptions (`java.lang.NullPointerException`), database errors (`ORA-00942`), and hex codes (`0x...`) first, followed by lower-priority keywords like `error`, `failed`, or `timeout`.
4.  **Grouping**: The first pattern that matches determines the error "key." All log entries matching that key are grouped together, along with their context (timestamp, file name, line number).
5.  **AI Augmentation**: When you request AI analysis, the tool sends the error key and a sample log line to your chosen LLM provider (Gemini, OpenAI, or a local model). The response, containing the description, impact, severity, and solution, is then displayed.

### üóÇÔ∏è Unparalleled Format Support

One of the standout features of the AI-Powered Log Analyzer Ultimate is its exceptionally broad support for a wide array of file formats. Unlike many specialized tools that lock you into specific log types, this analyzer is designed to be a universal workbench for virtually any text-based data you throw at it.

#### Input File Extensions (29 Total)
The tool recognizes a vast range of file extensions, categorized below for clarity:

-   **General & Text-Based**: `.log`, `.txt`, `.text`, `.out`, `.md`
-   **Structured Data**: `.csv`, `.xml`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`
-   **Web Server Logs**: `.iis`, `.access`, `.nginx`, `.apache`
-   **System & OS Logs**: `.syslog`, `.auth`, `.dmesg`, `.messages`, `.evtx`, `.etl`
-   **Configuration Files**: `.ini`, `.inf`, `.config`
-   **Source Code (for debugging)**: `.sql`, `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.cs`
-   **Archive Formats**: `.zip` (fully supported), `.gz`, `.tar` (read as text)
-   **Specialized Formats**: `.cap` (for network captures, parser pending)

**Note on Binary/Archive Files**: True `.zip` extraction is fully implemented. However, binary formats like `.evtx`, `.etl`, and `.cap`, along with compressed `.gz` and `.tar` files, are currently read as plain text. For best results with these types, we recommend converting them to a text-based format (like CSV or TXT) before analysis.

#### Parsing Formats (22 Total)
Beyond just recognizing file types, the analyzer provides a suite of parsers to correctly interpret their content.

-   **`AUTO` (Default & Recommended)**: Intelligently selects the best parser based on the file's extension and content, doing the heavy lifting for you.
-   **Common Parsers**: Includes `TEXTLINE` (for generic line-by-line logs), `CSV`, `TSV`, `XML`, and `JSON`.
-   **Web Server Parsers**: `W3C`, `IIS`, `NCSA`, `IISW3C`, and `HTTPERR` for standardized web log formats.
-   **Specialized Parsers**: `REG` for Windows Registry files.
-   **Note on Unimplemented Parsers**: To ensure maximum compatibility, 10 advanced parsers (including `EVT`, `ETW`, `NETMON`) are listed as placeholders. If selected, they gracefully fall back to the robust `TEXTLINE` parser, ensuring that no file is rejected.

This comprehensive support ensures that no matter where your logs come from‚Äîa web server, a database, a custom application, or a system daemon‚Äîthis tool can handle it, making it one of the most versatile log analyzers available.

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Limitations

#### Common Issues
-   **"No potential errors found"**: Your log files may not contain keywords or patterns the analyzer recognizes. Verify the files contain terms like `error`, `exception`, `failed`, or known error codes.
-   **AI Analysis Fails**:
    1.  Check that your API Key and Endpoint are correct in the settings.
    2.  Ensure your local Ollama server is running if you're using a custom provider.
    3.  You may have hit the rate limits of your API provider's free tier.
-   **Timeline Chart is Empty**: The chart requires **severity** data. Run AI analysis on your errors to populate it. Also, ensure your logs have recognizable timestamps.
-   **Browser is Slow or Unresponsive**: Analyzing very large files (>500MB) can consume significant memory. Try splitting large files or using a machine with more RAM.

#### Current Limitations
-   **Parser Implementation**: Several specialized parsers (`.evtx`, `.etl`, `.netmon`) are not yet implemented and treat files as plain text. This is ineffective for binary formats.
-   **Archive Support**: Only `.zip` archives are decompressed. `.gz` and `.tar` are not.
-   **Error Detection**: The detection logic is based on a predefined set of patterns. It may miss novel or context-specific errors.
-   **Data Explorer**: The query engine is experimental and only supports `...WHERE message contains 'value'`.
